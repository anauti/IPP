    "In this exercise we will get familiar with leadin order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) simulation. As you might know, beyond the tree level things can get messy. The NLO Feynman diagrams need to be taken into account and for instance the cross section calculation becomes harder. As we will see, things change for the experimentalists as well. \n",

    "Your task this week is to analyse two datasets. One is a ttbar process simulated in LO and the other is a ttbar process in NLO. These simulations have been made in the framework of CMS detector by following the circumstances of 2016 data taking. This means that we are looking at proton-proton collisions with \\sqrt{s} = 13TeV center-of-mass energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: You will need to take into account that the NLO simulation has negative weights! The negative weights are an artifact of the crossection calculation. There some terms get a negative weight from a fermion loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weight assigned to and event can be found from a variable called 'GenWeight'.\n",
    "When normalising the histograms, take into account that the datasets have different amount of events. \n",
    "Use the number of events that you get after taking into account the negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the normalisation use need to know the theoretical crossection of the process. So if we asume the mass of the top quark to be 172.5 GeV.\n",
    "The latest calculated theoretical cross section is 831.76 pb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is now to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Read the data sets\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Impose cuts in few variables \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Plot the variables of interest \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Study the differences between LO and NLO simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "5) After that we study b jets\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Impose identification criteria on jets\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Tag b jets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are studying jets. Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons. The difference of LO and NLO can be seen for instance in the jet distributions. Use the variables 'jets_MC' in your jet studies. \n",
