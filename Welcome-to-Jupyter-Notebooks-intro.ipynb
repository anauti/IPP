    "Notebooks present a very approachable and accessible platform for rich and varied spectrum of possible exercises. As you can see, the user interface is pretty intuitive and innocent looking: you can combine instructions and assignments very easily, put readable text between code blocks and everything is in front of you without a ton of pop ups or extra windows getting tangled up with each other. This can be an important step in making programming less daunting for newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important feature is the ease of setup: Notebooks can be run entirely in browser without any installations or log-ins required. [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) is probably the easiest tool to use when the teacher has their materials in a Github-repository, either their own or one like [this](https://github.com/cms-opendata-education). Binder creates a virtual workspace that you can use for some time and which then disappears when you're finished. This usually doesn't take more than a few minutes and you're good to go. As the workspace is only temporal, the students are free to explore the documents in front of them, make changes and try things out without altering the master copy. If you wish to save your work, you can download the file as it currently is via *File* $\\rightarrow$ *Download as* $\\rightarrow$ *Notebook (.ipynb)*. That file can then later on be uploaded to a new workspace and you can carry on with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks aren't CERN-specific, nor is MyBinder. Their reasonably wide userbase means it's pretty easy to google things out if you wish to expand your use, say for an example, to other programming languages like C++ or Ruby. In these materials we use Python 3 as it is a very powerful and intuitive language which is also used in real scientific computing. "
